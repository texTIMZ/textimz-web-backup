== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I create a newsletter subscriber in the backend of the site? =

Yes. You just need to create a new user with the role of "Mail Subscriber" in Users > Add New.

= How can the user unsubscribe from the newsletter? =

1) The user should go to your site, enter his/her e-mail in the Subscribe Form, mark the "unsubscribe" checkbocx and click the "Submit" button. 
2) If everything has been done correctly, he/she will recieve a mail with a link for unsubscription.
3) If the user follows that link, he/she will be automatically unsubscribed from the newsletters.

= How can the previously registered users subscribe for the newsletter? =

The previously registered users can subscribe for the newsletter exactly as any other site visitor thru the Subscribe Form or mark the "Subscribe for newsletters" checkbox on their Profile editing page.  

= Why do I need the blacklist? =

If you do not want the user to receive letters of mailing for some reason, you can move him to the blacklist. Users from the black list can not receive letters and resubscribe for the mailing.

= I would like to add checkbox "Subscribe" to the custom form on my website. How can I do this? =

1. Install the Subscribe plugin and activate it.
2. Open the file with the form (where you would like to add checkbox "Subscribe" to).
3. Find a place to insert the code for the checkbox "Subscribe" output.
4. Insert the necessary lines: 

if ( has_filter( 'sbscrbr_checkbox_add' ) ) {
	$sbscrbr_checkbox = apply_filters( 'sbscrbr_checkbox_add', false );
	if ( isset( $sbscrbr_checkbox['content'] ) ) {
	 	echo $sbscrbr_checkbox['content'];
	}
}

If the form is HTML you should insert the line with the PHP tags:

<?php if ( has_filter( 'sbscrbr_checkbox_add' ) ) {
	$sbscrbr_checkbox = apply_filters( 'sbscrbr_checkbox_add', false );
	if ( isset( $sbscrbr_checkbox['content'] ) ) {
	 	echo $sbscrbr_checkbox['content'];
	}
} ?>

5. Then you should add the lines to the function of the entered data checking:

if ( isset( $_POST['submit'] ) && has_filter( 'sbscrbr_checkbox_check' ) ) {
	$sbscrbr_check = apply_filters( 'sbscrbr_checkbox_check', array(
		'email' => isset( $_POST['email'] ) ? $_POST['email'] : ''
	) );
	if ( isset( $sbscrbr_check['response'] ) ) {
		echo $sbscrbr_check['response']['message'];
	}
}

or 

<?php if ( isset( $_POST['submit'] ) && has_filter( 'sbscrbr_checkbox_check' ) ) {
	$sbscrbr_check = apply_filters( 'sbscrbr_checkbox_check', array(
		'email' => isset( $_POST['email'] ) ? $_POST['email'] : ''
	) );
	if ( isset( $sbscrbr_check['response'] ) ) {
		echo $sbscrbr_check['response']['message'];
	}
} ?>

where:

- $_POST['submit'] is a name of the submit form button;
- $_POST['email'] is a name of the field with entered e-mail;
